I don't have the original content of `src/components/AssessmentForm.tsx` in the provided files, so I can't accurately reconstruct what the AI meant to put there. The AI only mentioned a specific fix for a TypeScript error in that file (changing `if (new Date(dueDate) < Date.now())` to `if (new Date(dueDate).getTime() < Date.now())`), but didn't provide the full file content.

Without seeing the original file, I cannot provide the complete code with the fix applied. You would need to share the original `src/components/AssessmentForm.tsx` file for me to properly replace the placeholder comments with the actual code.
